This is a simple database engine I created in Racket for the "Methods of programming" (https://zapisy.ii.uni.wroc.pl/courses/metody-programowania-202122-letni) classes during my first year at uni.

The statement (in Polish) can be found in the `statement.pdf` file. The engine supports the following SQL queries:
- `INSERT`
- `SELECT a FROM t WHERE b`
- `ALTER TABLE t RENAME COLUMN a TO b`
- `CROSS JOIN`
- `NATURAL JOIN`
