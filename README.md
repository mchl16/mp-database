This is a simple database engine I created in Racket for the "Methods of programming" (https://zapisy.ii.uni.wroc.pl/courses/metody-programowania-202122-letni) classes during my first year at uni.

The statement can be found in the `` file. The engine supports the following SQL queries:
-`INSERT`
-`SELECT`
-`CROSS JOIN`
-`NATURAL JOIN`
